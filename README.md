Breaking GFW with hosts file

Due to the Chinese government is using the GFW blocking the web access to some world famous sites like twitter, Facebook, and Wikipedia etc., we made this hosts file to help people to get through the Great Firewall.
This project could provide installer for hosts on Windows and Macintosh. You could also get the online-installer here which could work in most operating systems.
