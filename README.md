Breaking GFW with hosts file

Due to the Chinese government is using the GFW blocking the web access to some world famous sites like Googel+, twitter, Facebook, and Wikipedia etc., we made these hosts files to help people to get through the Great Firewall.
This project could provide installer for hosts on Windows, Macintosh and Linux. You could also get the online-installer here which could work in most operating systems.
